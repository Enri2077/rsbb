RSBB benchmark script tutorial
=================================================

This tutorial covers how to develop a simple benchmark.
The Simple Test Benchmark (STB) will be used as an example to learn how to develop a simple benchmark, that can also be used to test the components of the RSBB and the communication between the robots and the RSBB since the benchmark uses most of the RSBB's components.


## Benchmark Scripts

A benchmark is defined in three files: the benchmarks_description.yaml configuration file, the benchmark's own configuration file and the benchmark's (python) script.
The Simple Test Benchmark, used in this tutorial, is part of the default installation of the RSBB and can be downloaded from the RSBB repo here: `TODO: link to rsbb/rsbb_bmbox/benchmarks_scripts/STB, etc`.

If you didn't already, install the entire RSBB by following these instructions: `TODO: link to rsbb installation instructions`.

### The Code

```python
#TODO insert STB.py
```

### The Configuration

#### The Benchmark's Description Configuration

```yaml
#TODO insert STB description from rsbb_etc/config/benchmarks_description.yaml
```

#### The Benchmark's Configuration

```yaml
#TODO insert STB example configuration from rsbb_bmbox/scripts/benchmarks_config/STB.yaml
```


### The Code and Configuration Explained

### Executing a Benchmark script
